# Task 04 â€“ Frontend

Create React app with Tailwind.

Pages:
1. **Login / Register**
   - Simple forms, connect to `/api/auth`
2. **Dashboard**
   - Show planet resources
   - Placeholder for buildings
3. **Fleet Management**
   - Show fleets
   - Form to send fleet (target planet id + ship count)
4. **Alliance (stub)**
   - Just "coming soon" placeholder

Use `fetch()` to call backend API.
Keep styling minimal, focus on working data flow.

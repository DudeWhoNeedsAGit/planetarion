3. **API Documentation**: Create OpenAPI/Swagger specification
4. **Combat System**: Implement basic fleet vs fleet mechanics

### Development Environment
- **Primary IDE**: VSCode with Python and React extensions
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub repository
- **Container Platform**: Docker Desktop with Docker Compose
- **Testing**: pytest for backend, Playwright for E2E
- **Documentation**: Markdown-based with .clinerules structure

### Code Quality Status
- **Backend**: Well-structured with blueprints, services, and models
- **Frontend**: Component-based architecture with hooks and context
- **Testing**: Comprehensive coverage but currently failing
- **Documentation**: Detailed README and API docs
- **Security**: Basic JWT auth, advanced features pending

## Active Development Branches

### Main Branch (Stable)
- **Status**: Contains working application with known test issues
- **Last Commit**: "Refactor .clinerules: convert file to folder structure with Markdown docs"
- **Test Status**: Backend tests failing, E2E tests blocked

### Development Branches (Planned)
- **feature/fix-models**: Resolve SQLAlchemy conflicts
- **feature/security**: Implement bcrypt and input validation
- **feature/combat-system**: Develop fleet combat mechanics
- **feature/websockets**: Real-time communication upgrade

## Current Architecture Decisions

### Database Choice
- **Current**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL planned for production
- **Rationale**: SQLite simplicity for development, PostgreSQL features for production
- **Migration Path**: Flask-Migrate handles schema changes

### Authentication Approach
- **Current**: JWT tokens with stateless sessions
- **Strengths**: Scalable, REST-friendly, no server-side sessions
- **Limitations**: Token expiration management, refresh token implementation pending

### Frontend State Management
- **Current**: React Context + Hooks for global state
- **Rationale**: Simple, built-in, sufficient for current scope
- **Future**: Redux or Zustand if complexity increases

### Testing Strategy
- **Current**: pytest + Playwright with Docker containers
- **Coverage**: Unit, integration, E2E test categories
- **Challenges**: Container orchestration, test data management

## Recent Changes & Decisions

### Documentation Restructure
- **Action**: Converted .clinerules from JSON file to Markdown folder structure
- **Impact**: Better readability, version control friendly
- **Files Created**: workflow.md, project_objectives.md, coding_style.md, docker-commands.md

### Memory Bank Initialization
- **Action**: Created memory-bank/ with project context files
- **Purpose**: Persistent project knowledge across sessions
- **Files**: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md

### Test Workflow Analysis
- **Finding**: Discrepancy between documented and actual test commands
- **Resolution**: Updated workflow.md to reflect Docker-based testing
- **Command**: Changed from direct pytest to `./run-tests.sh all`

## Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### Model Architecture
- **Question**: Should we refactor models to avoid naming conflicts?
- **Options**: Rename classes, use explicit imports, restructure modules
- **Impact**: Affects all database operations and tests

### Testing Strategy
- **Question**: How to handle Docker-based testing in CI/CD?
- **Options**: GitHub Actions with Docker, separate test environment
- **Impact**: Development workflow and deployment pipeline

### Security Implementation
- **Question**: Priority order for security features?
- **Options**: Password hashing first, then rate limiting, then input validation
- **Impact**: Development timeline and feature rollout

### Real-time Updates
- **Question**: WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events vs polling?
- **Options**: WebSocket for bidirectional, SSE for server-push, polling for simplicity
- **Impact**: Architecture complexity and performance

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Security Gaps**: Plain text passwords, no rate limiting

### Medium Risk
- **Scalability Concerns**: Current architecture may not handle high load
- **Technical Debt**: Some quick implementations may need refactoring
- **Documentation Sync**: Multiple documentation sources to maintain

### Low Risk
- **Feature Completeness**: Core gameplay features implemented
- **UI/UX Quality**: Responsive design with good user experience
- **Deployment Readiness**: Docker setup provides good foundation

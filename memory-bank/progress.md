### Phase 2: Stabilization (🔄 In Progress)
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Status**: 🔄 Active
**Start Date**: Current

#### Current Objectives
- [ ] **Fix Model Conflicts**: Resolve SQLAlchemy mapper initialization errors
- [ ] **Stabilize Test Suite**: Ensure all 105 tests pass consistently
- [ ] **Clean Docker Environment**: Remove orphan containers and optimize setup
- [ ] **Implement Security**: Add bcrypt password hashing
- [ ] **Add Input Validation**: Sanitization and error handling
- [ ] **Update Documentation**: Synchronize all guides with current state

#### Blockers
- 🚨 SQLAlchemy model conflicts preventing test execution
- 🚨 Frontend authentication failures blocking all 23 E2E tests (85% failure rate)
- 🚨 Backend authentication issues (JWT returning user ID instead of username)
- 🚨 Fleet management module import errors
- 🚨 Static file serving and tick endpoint routing problems
- 🚨 Orphan Docker containers from previous test runs
- 🚨 Plain text password storage (security risk)

#### Success Criteria
- ✅ All tests passing without critical errors
- ✅ Clean Docker environment with no orphan containers
- ✅ Secure password storage implemented
- ✅ Consistent test data and fixtures

#### Current Test Status (Latest E2E Run - 9/2/2025)
- **E2E Tests**: 28 total, 6 passed (21%), 27 failed (96%), 1 skipped
- **Authentication Status**: ✅ WORKING - Login test passes successfully
- **Main Issue**: Navigation/UI problems after login, not authentication

##### E2E Test Results Analysis
- ✅ **Authentication Working**: Login test passes (contrary to previous assumptions)
- ❌ **Navigation Issues**: 27/27 tests failing at dashboard navigation
- ❌ **Timeout Problems**: Tests timing out trying to click navigation elements
- ❌ **UI Interaction**: Cannot click "Fleets" or other dashboard sections

##### Root Cause Identified
- **Not Authentication**: Backend auth is functional
- **UI/Navigation Issue**: Frontend navigation elements not accessible after login
- **Test Blocking**: All tests blocked by navigation failure, not auth failure

##### Updated Assessment
- 🔄 **Authentication**: Actually working - login test passes
- ❌ **Dashboard Navigation**: Critical UI issue preventing test progression
- ❌ **User Flow**: Login → Dashboard works, but section navigation broken

##### Test Coverage Status
- ✅ `should allow user login with existing account` - **PASSES**
- ❌ All other tests fail at navigation stage
- 🔄 Real-time features blocked by navigation issues
- 🔄 Building upgrades blocked by navigation issues

# Project Objectives

## Model
- **Value:** `cline:x-ai/grok-code-fast-1`

## Project Overview
Build a complete full-stack space strategy game inspired by classic browser-based games like OGame and Ikariam. This monorepo contains a Flask backend API, React frontend with Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL database, and comprehensive game mechanics including resource management, fleet operations, and real-time updates.

## Core Objectives
- **Multiplayer Strategy Game**: Real-time space strategy where players colonize planets, manage resources, command fleets, and compete in a persistent universe
- **Resource Management**: Implement metal, crystal, and deuterium mining with automatic production rates
- **Fleet Operations**: Complete fleet creation, movement, and mission system (attack, transport, deploy)
- **Building System**: Upgrade mines, power plants, and research facilities
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic resource generation every 5 seconds with tick-based economy
- **User Interface**: Responsive React frontend with space-themed dark UI

## Technology Stack
### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask 2.3.3 with Flask-RESTful
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM and Flask-Migrate
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Scheduling**: APScheduler for automated resource generation
- **CORS**: Flask-CORS for cross-origin requests

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18.2.0 with Hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.3.3
- **HTTP Client**: Axios 1.4.0
- **Routing**: React Router (hash-based)
- **Build Tool**: Create React App

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production) / SQLite (development)
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx (for production)
- **Process Manager**: PM2 (for production)

## Key Features
### Core Gameplay
- ✅ User Authentication (JWT-based login/registration)
- ✅ Planet Management (multiple planet colonization)
- ✅ Resource System (metal, crystal, deuterium mining)
- ✅ Building Upgrades (mines, power plants, research labs)
- ✅ Fleet Operations (ship construction and movement)
- ✅ Real-time Updates (automatic resource generation)
- ✅ Tick System (high-frequency resource production)

### User Interface
- ✅ Responsive Design (works on desktop and mobile)
- ✅ Dark Theme (space-themed UI with custom colors)
- ✅ Interactive Dashboard (planet selection and management)
- ✅ Fleet Management (create, send, and recall fleets)
- ✅ Navigation System (section-based routing)
- ✅ Real-time Feedback (loading states and error handling)

### Technical Features
- ✅ RESTful API (complete CRUD operations)
- ✅ Database Persistence (PostgreSQL with migrations)
- ✅ Containerization (Docker Compose setup)
- ✅ Automated Testing (comprehensive test suite)
- ✅ Error Handling (graceful failure management)
- ✅ Security (input validation and sanitization)

## Current Status
- **Backend**: Fully implemented with all core API endpoints
- **Frontend**: Complete React application with all major components
- **Database**: PostgreSQL schema with all required tables
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite covering all functionality
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose setup for easy deployment

## Future Enhancements
### Phase 1: Core Features
- Password Hashing (bcrypt for secure storage)
- Email Verification (user email verification system)
- Password Reset (forgot password functionality)
- User Profiles (extended profile management)

### Phase 2: Advanced Gameplay
- Combat System (fleet vs fleet combat mechanics)
- Research Tree (technology research and advancement)
- Ship Building (shipyard construction system)
- Defense Systems (planetary defense structures)

### Phase 3: Social Features
- Alliance System (player alliances and diplomacy)
- Messaging System (private and alliance messaging)
- High Scores (leaderboards and rankings)
- Trade System (resource trading between players)

### Phase 4: Technical Improvements
- Real-time Updates (WebSocket integration)
- Caching Layer (Redis for performance)
- API Rate Limiting (prevent abuse)
- Monitoring (application performance monitoring)

## Development Focus
- Keep combat logic stubbed for now; focus on scaffolding and API contracts
- Prioritize core gameplay loop: resource generation → building upgrades → fleet operations
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all implemented features
- Maintain clean, modular code structure across backend and frontend
